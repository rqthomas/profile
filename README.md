## Ecosystem Dynamics and Forecasting

*Ecosystems:*

We study the forest and freshwater ecosystems upon which society depends

*Dynamics:* We model how ecosystems change over time in response to land-use, climate change, atmospheric deposition, and management.  We measure carbon, water, and energy exchange between ecosystems and the atmosphere using eddy-covariance and biometeorology sensors.

*Forecasting:* We predict the future of ecosystems by combining observations and ecosystem models using statistical techniques.
