# Ecosystem Dynamics and Forecasting

**Ecosystem:**  Studying the forest and freshwater ecosystems upon which society depends

**Dynamics:**  Modeling how ecosystems change over time in response to land-use, climate change, atmospheric deposition, and management.  

**Forecasting:**  Predicting the future of ecosystems by combining observations and ecosystem models using statistical techniques.
