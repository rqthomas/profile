# Ecosystem Dynamics and Forecasting

**Ecosystem:**  We study the forest and freshwater ecosystems upon which society depends

**Dynamics:**  We model how ecosystems change over time in response to land-use, climate change, atmospheric deposition, and management.  We measure carbon, water, and energy exchange between ecosystems and the atmosphere using eddy-covariance and biometeorology sensors.

**Forecasting:**  We predict the future of ecosystems by combining observations and ecosystem models using statistical techniques.

## Projects

[Ecological Forecasting Initiative Research Coordination Network](https://ecoforecast.org/rcn/) [(DEB-1926388)](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1926388&HistoricalAwards=false)

Lead PI of an NSF sponsored 5-year project that is leading workshops, conferences, and collaborative software development to address the following objectives:
1. Define [community standards](https://ecoforecast.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Forecasting-Standards-Draft-v0.1-2020-05.pdf) and [best practices](https://ecoforecast.org/reproducible-forecasting-workflows/) for developing, sharing, and archiving forecasts and models
2. Increase the number and diversity of NEON-enabled [(National Ecological Observatory Network)](https://www.neonscience.org) forecasts by developing and hosting the [NEON Ecological Forecasting Challenge](https://ecoforecast.org/efi-rcn-forecast-challenges/)
3. Create educational materials to empower scientists at all career stages to forecast using NEON data products
4. Support the creation of [software](https://github.com/eco4cast) to produce NEON-enabled forecasts at intensive and collaborative coding-focused workshops
5. Align forecast outputs and decision support with the needs of forecast users at mission-driven agencies to guide decision making, and
6. Synthesize forecasts to examine how limits to forecastability vary across ecological systems and scales.
