# Ecosystem Dynamics and Forecasting

**Ecosystem:**  We study the forest and freshwater ecosystems upon which society depends

**Dynamics:**  We model how ecosystems change over time in response to land-use, climate change, atmospheric deposition, and management.  

**Forecasting:**  We predict the future of ecosystems by combining observations and ecosystem models using statistical techniques.

## Projects

[Ecological Forecasting Initiative Research Coordination Network](https://ecoforecast.org/rcn/) [(DEB-1926388)](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1926388&HistoricalAwards=false)

Lead PI of an NSF-sponsored 5-year project that is leading workshops, conferences, and collaborative software development to address the following objectives:
1. Define [community standards](https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.4686) and [best practices](https://doi.org/10.1002/eap.2500) for developing, sharing, and archiving forecasts and models
2. Increase the number and diversity of NEON-enabled [(National Ecological Observatory Network)](https://www.neonscience.org) forecasts by developing and hosting the [NEON Ecological Forecasting Challenge](https://doi.org/10.1002/fee.2616)
3. Create educational materials ([here](https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.10001) and [here](https://doi.org/10.21105/jose.00259))to empower scientists at all career stages to forecast using NEON data products.
4. Support the creation of [software](https://github.com/eco4cast) to produce NEON-enabled forecasts at intensive and [collaborative coding-focused workshops](https://ecoforecast.org/efi-rcn-unconference-2023/).
5. Align forecast outputs and decision support with the needs of forecast users at [mission-driven agencies](https://projects.ecoforecast.org/usgsrc4cast-ci/) to guide decision-making.
6. Synthesize forecasts to examine how limits to forecastability vary across ecological systems and scales (e.g., [canopy phenology](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2023.109810), [lake water temperature](https://doi.org/10.1002/fee.2623)).
